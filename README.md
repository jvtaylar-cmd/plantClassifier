# deep-learning-model-deployment-using-streamlit
This model is trained to classify among 30 differnt type of leaves.
The model is deployed using streamlit to make it better for presentation.
Note that accuracy of model is low because the main focus is only to find a way to deploy it and use during any presentation.
Code might need changes as per the system and location of different files in that system. One having some knowledge of tensorflow and deep learning models can use the code easily.
Changes required:  Change the location of plant_classifier in app.py.
App.py contains the actual code as well as app code. This code to used as a reference for making different models by changing the dataset.
After making the required changes model can be run by coomand "streamlit run <location>/app.py"
